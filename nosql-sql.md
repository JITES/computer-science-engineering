**Scalability**

RDBMS scales vertically however NoSQL scales horizontally as no relationship exists 

NoSQL is decentralised nature, distributed across multiple hosts rather than a single monolithic server

****Flexible Data Requirements****

NoSQL greatest strength is its ability to handle flexible data storage. Traditional RDMS relies on static data structure. 

**Concurrent Performance**

No locking in NoSQL and RDBMS uses a locking mechanism to ensure data integrity

**Reads vs Write ratio**
